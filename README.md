## Doomscroll Breaker – Chrome Extension (v3.3)

> A Chrome Extension designed to help you fight **doomscrolling on YouTube Shorts** by enforcing mindful viewing limits, breaks, and analytics to track your daily habits.
> YouTube Shorts can be addictive — and before you know it, you’ve lost an hour to endless scrolling.  
**Doomscroll Breaker** gives you back control by limiting how many Shorts you can watch in one session, enforcing short breaks, and even blocking YouTube for the day after repeated overuse.
> It also provides a **visual dashboard** showing your usage stats, content types (educational vs entertainment), and your 7-day viewing trends — right inside the extension popup.

# Features

| Category | Description |
|-----------|--------------|
| **Shorts Session Limit** | Watch up to 10 Shorts before a 2-minute enforced break. |
| **Smart Break System** | If you restart scrolling after a break, YouTube is blocked for the rest of the day. |
| **Floating Overlay Counter** | A small in-video counter shows how many Shorts you’ve watched. |
| **Usage Dashboard** | View Shorts watched, breaks taken, and block status. |
| **7-Day History** | Track how your Shorts usage changes over the week. |
| **AI-Inspired Classifier** | Categorizes Shorts as *Educational*, *Entertainment*, or *Neutral* based on the title. |

# How It Works

1. Content Script (content.js)
- Runs on YouTube Shorts pages to count how many videos you’ve watched.
- When the limit is reached → triggers a break overlay or blocks access for the day.

2.Popup Dashboard (popup.html + popup.js)
- Displays your stats using Chart.js — progress, history, and content types.

3.Background Service Worker (background.js)
- Handles daily resets and message passing.
