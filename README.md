A Chrome extension designed to **fight doomscrolling on YouTube Shorts**.  
It helps you take control of your time by limiting Shorts consumption, forcing breaks, and even **blocking YouTube for the rest of the day** after repeated overuse.

 Features
- **Shorts Session Limit** → Watch up to 10 Shorts before a forced 2-minute break.  
- **Block After 2 Sessions** → If you restart doomscrolling after a break, YouTube is **completely blocked for the day**.  
- **Floating Overlay Counter** → Always see how many Shorts you’ve watched.  
- **Daily Reset** → Stats reset at midnight automatically.  
- **Usage Dashboard** → Popup shows:
  - Shorts watched today  
  - Breaks taken  
  - Block status  
  - Weekly history chart
